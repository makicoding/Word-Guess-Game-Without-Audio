### Welcome to Retro Diner's '80s Music Hangman game night!

There are a total of 5 different games that will be selected at random.

Start the game by typing your first letter choice.

User can enter letters in either lower case or upper case.

When a user presses the same key twice, this does not affect the win score, and duplicate letters will not be added to the "Letters Already Guessed" list.

Since this is a hangman game, a question will appear for the user to guess the word.

Within the 5 games are a 2 that have multiple words (one that is 2 words, and one that is 3 words) that are separated by a space between them.
